INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
Ships....The U.S. Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) program needs your 
help!  If your ship is not participating in this worthwhile international 
program, we urge you to join. Remember, the meteorological agencies 
that do the weather forecasting cannot help you without input from you. 
ONLY YOU KNOW THE WEATHER AT YOUR POSITION!!  
 
Please report the weather at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 UTC as  
explained in the National Weather Service Observing Handbook No. 1  
for Marine Surface Weather Observations.   
 
Within 300 nm of a named hurricane, typhoon or tropical storm, or within 
200 nm of U.S. or Canadian waters, also report the weather at 0300, 
0900, 1500, and 2100 UTC.  Your participation is greatly appreciated by 
all mariners. 
 
For assistance, contact a Port Meteorological Officer (PMO), who will 
come aboard your vessel and provide all the information you need to 
observe, code and transmit weather observations.

ABOUT THIS PUBLICATION    
 
 
 
The schedules contained in this publication were obtained from official and 
unofficial sources. The information herein may neither be complete or accurate. 
 Wherever possible, the schedules are dated with the latest change available.  
The National Weather Service would like to thank everyone who provided 
assistance. 
 
For ease of use, all stations are listed by WMO region, in alphabetical order, by 
country and location.  All times listed herein are Universal Coordinated Time 
(UTC), unless otherwise indicated. 
 
Unless otherwise stated, assigned frequencies are shown, for carrier frequency 
subtract 1.9 kHz. Typically dedicated radiofax receivers use assigned 
frequencies, while receivers or transceivers, connected to external recorders or 
PC's, are operated in the upper sideband (USB) mode using carrier 
frequencies.  
 
For information on weather broadcasts worldwide, also refer to NGA Publication 
117, the Canadian Coast Guard Radio Aids to Navigation (Canada Only) and 
the British Admiralty List of Signals, which are updated through Notices to 
Mariners.  Information on these and other marine weather publications may be 
found in Appendix D.  These publications are HIGHLY recommended. 
 
This document also includes information on how to obtain National Weather 
Service text forecasts, graphic forecasts, and marine observations via the 
Internet and e-mail (FTPMAIL). Mariners are highly encouraged to explore 
these options.   
 
This PDF file contains links to http pages and FTPMAIL commands. The links 
may not be compatible with all PDF readers and e-mail systems.  The Internet is 
not part of the National Weather Service's operational data stream and should 
never be relied upon as a means to obtain the latest forecast and warning data.

surfers, and others - the WEBCAM which displays live images of current conditions. To find WEBCAMS 
for marine areas use your favorite Internet search engine to search for such key words as Beach Cams, 
Surf Cams, Coastal Cams, Ocean Cams, Port Cams and Cruise Cams. You may wish to refine your 
search by adding your geographic area to the search's key words.  
 
 
 
Buoy and Other Real-Time Observations  
The latest coastal and offshore weather observations from NOAA fixed and drifting data buoys and 
Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) stations may be found at the National Data Buoy Center 
http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ webpage. Real time meteorological and oceanographic observations for 
several sites are also available from the Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (Ports) 
http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html. PORTS is a program of the U.S. National Ocean 
Service http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/ that supports safe and cost-efficient navigation by providing ship 
masters and pilots with accurate real-time information required to avoid groundings and collisions. 
Several National Ocean Service tide gages are also equipped with ancillary meteorological 
sensors http://tidesonline.nos.noaa.gov/geographic.html. Regionally focused observation data may 
also be found on the webpages of local NWS Forecast Offices 
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/marine_map.htm. Some marine observations may also be found 
on our NWS Marine Product Listing and Schedule

local NWS Forecast Office http://www.weather.gov/organization.php.   
 
The "Operational Forecast System" Model Guidance from the National Ocean Service 
http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/models.html have been created to provide the maritime 
community with improved short-term predictions of water levels. Please be advised that these 
predictions are based on a hydrodynamic model and, as such, should be considered as 
computer-generated forecast guidance. 
 
 
For Emergency Responders and Planners  
NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration, National Ocean Service 
http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/index.php, offers a series of job aids and software to predict 
weather and ocean affects on the trajectory of hazardous materials such as oil spills. The information may 
be helpful for further applications as well.  
 
  
 
Historic Weather Forecasts, Satellite Images and Oceanographic Data  
For historic weather forecasts, satellite images and oceanographic data, contact the National Climatic 
Data Center and National Oceanographic Data Center, found on our listing of Phone Numbers and 
Addresses http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/phone.htm.  
 
 
Observations from Mariners  
All NWS marine forecasts rely heavily on the Voluntary Observing Ship 
(VOS)http://www.vos.noaa.gov/program for obtaining meteorological observations. Ship observations 
may also be found on National Data Buoy Center - Observations Search 
(http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/os.shtml), National Data Buoy Center - Ships Observation Report 
(http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ship_obs.php), CoolWX, SailWX.info, and Oceanweather, webpages.  
 
The National Weather Service has a number of other volunteer observation programs including the 
SKYWARN, MAREP, MAROB, MARS, APRSWXNET/Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP) 
and the Cooperative Observer Program (COOP)  see 
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/voluntary.htm which are of benefit to the marine community.  
 
 
 
APPENDIX A-4 
 
Marine Webpages  
The Internet contains a great number of webpages of interest to the mariner. Visit our Links 
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/mlinks.htm page for a listing of recommended webpages 
pertaining to Marine Weather. The U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Telecommunications Information 
webpage http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=maritimeTelecomms contains an excellent 
description of marine communication systems. There are also many other Internet sites of interest to the 
mariner. Use one the Internet search engines to search on topics such as "marine weather", "radiofax", 
"radiofacsimile", "weather buoys", "tides", etc. The NOAA Library http://www.lib.noaa.gov/ provides an 
excellent listing of links to marine related webpages within NOAA and elsewhere.  
 
Marine Weather Publications On the Web  
Many marine weather related government publications are available on the Web. Visit our publications 
webpage http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/marine/pub.htm for several we recommend including our 
popular Marine Service Charts, the Weather Log Magazine, and our listing of Worldwide Marine 
Radiofacsimile Broadcast Schedules.  
 
Internet Access for Mariners  
Internet at sea can be problematic unless you stay within cellular telephone range of shore.  "Marine 
WIFI" technology is rapidly becoming popular at marinas and in favorite harbor areas. Satellite services 
including Inmarsat,   Iridium,   Globalstar,     Thuraya,     Emsat,     ACeS,   tracNet/DirecPC,   Boatracs,  
Orbcomm , and MTN are available, however, costs are generally greater.  Several companies offer e-mail 
services designed to optimize satellite connectivity including MAILASAIL, OCENS, UUPLUS and XGate . 
Full Internet access is often available if you have a satellite terminal onboard, but presently unless you 
restrict your use to e-mail messages, costs can be high. A number of satellite services such as Inmarsat-
C offer e-mail messaging services only and provide no access to the World Wide Web. Several 
transmission and data compression schemes are available and in development to make the Web more 
accessible to the mariner. There are also several public FTP-to-EMAIL and WWW-to-EMAIL servers 
available to allow Internet access for users who do not have direct or cost effective access to the World 
Wide Web but who are equipped with an e-mail system. CLICK HERE for information. Low cost, 
worldwide, access to the World Wide Web via satellite should be available to the mariner in the next five 
to ten years.   
 If you have an HF marine radio, E-mail service is available from companies such as Sailmail, 
CruiseEmail, Global Marine Networks, Kielradio, Globe Wireless and Shipcomm LLC (WLO/KLB). E-mail 
can be accomplished at no cost using amateur radio.   
The domain of the Internet is rapidly expanding to now include wireless devices such as so-called 
"Internet-Ready" digital cellular phones and Personal Data Assistants (PDAs). These offer great potential 
for making marine forecasts available to coastal mariners, who have limited other options available. The 
majority of these other options are by voice where there is always the possibility of misunderstanding.  
    A webpage for the most popular marine text forecasts compatible with many celphones and PDA's may 
be found at cell.weather.gov.  
    A low bandwidth webpage containing marine and public forecasts intended for mobile devices may be 
found at: mobile.weather.gov (includes a capability to view the forecast for any zip/city and radar 
images).  
    Visit http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutwap.shtml where you will find NHC's wireless web page. There you 
can find the link to obtain NHC's most popular hurricane products, offshore forecasts, and high seas 
forecasts.  
   
 
APPENDIX A-5

FTPMAIL INSTRUCTIONS 
 
 
National Weather Service marine text forecasts, radiofax charts and buoy 
observations are available via e-mail. Further, FTPMAIL may be used to 
acquire any file on the tgftp.nws.noaa.gov FTP server. The FTPMAIL 
server is intended to allow Internet access for mariners and other users 
who do not have direct access to the World Wide Web but who are 
equipped with an e-mail system. Turnaround is generally in under one 
hour, however, performance may vary widely and receipt cannot be 
guaranteed. 
 
 
This PDF file contains links to http pages and FTPMAIL commands. 
The links may not be compatible with all PDF readers and e-mail 
systems.  The Internet is not part of the National Weather Service's 
operational data stream and should never be relied upon as a means 
to obtain the latest forecast and warning data. Become familiar with 
and use other means such as NOAA Weather Radio to obtain the 
latest forecasts and warnings. Please read our disclaimer

**** IMPORTANT NOTICES **** Read these notes carefully **** 
 
Effective January 08, 2008, the address of the FTPMAIL service changed  
from ftpmail@weather.noaa.gov to ftpmail@ftpmail.nws.noaa.gov.   
If you restrict incoming e-mail as a means of preventing spam, you must 
configure your e-mail system to allow mail from ftpmail@ftpmail.nws.noaa.gov  
 
CAUTION - READ THIS HELP FILE CAREFULLY - 99% OF ERRORS USING FTPMAIL  
ARE SIMPLE TYPO'S, INCORRECT CAPITALIZATION, FAILURE TO SEND IN PLAIN  
TEXT FORMAT, LEADING OR TRAILING SPACES, OR FAILURE TO SET UP ANY SPAM  
FILTERS PROPERLY. FOLLOW THE EXAMPLES CLOSELY! 
 
FTPMAIL e-mail requests must be sent in ASCII/Plain Text only.   
HTML formatting will likely result in no response from the FTPMAIL 
server.   
 
This "help" file contains a detailed description of the FTPMAIL system  
and available products. To obtain another copy of the FTPMAIL "help" file:

tgftp.nws.noaa.gov is the only valid FTP site for this service. 
 
   
This National Weather Service (NWS) FTPMAIL server is intended to 
allow Internet access for users who do not have direct access to 
the World Wide Web but who are equipped with an e-mail system.  
The service is free and no signup is required.  Using FTPMAIL, 
users can request files from NWS and have them automatically 
e-mailed back to them.  Turnaround is generally in under one 
 
hour, however, performance may vary widely and receipt cannot be 
guaranteed. 
 
NOTICE - Check time and date of forecasts. Downloaded data may not  
represent the latest forecast. The Internet is not part of the  
National Weather Service's operational data stream and should never  
be relied upon as a means to obtain the latest forecast and warning  
data. Become familiar with and use other means such as NOAA Weather  
Radio to obtain the latest forecasts and warnings. Please read our  
disclaimer at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/disclaimer.php 
 
Although these instructions are tailored for marine users to gain 
access to graphic(radiofax) and text products via e-mail, all 
publicly available data on the tgftp.nws.noaa.gov Internet FTP  
server is accessible using the FTPMAIL service.   
 
To use FTPMAIL, the user sends a small script file via e-mail to 
NWS requesting the desired file(s). A list of available product 
directories, retrievable via FTPMAIL is shown below. 
 
Users should be familiar with sending and receiving messages and 
attachments with their particular e-mail system.  Attachments are 
received in UUencoded form.  The majority of modern e-mail systems  
handle the conversion automatically, other users will need to run  
the UUdecode program for their particular system. If your e-mail  
system does not UUENCODE automatically, you will get back a bunch  
of gibberish starting with something like "begin 600 PWAE98.TIF"  
See your system administrator if you have any questions on this  
topic. UUdecode freeware and shareware may also be found on the Web,  
but the easier solution is to try a different e-mail system if that  
option is open  to you. The UUencoding process can add 0 to >100%  
overhead depending on your system and the type of file.   
 
Files which are greater than approximately 400KB in length may be  
sent as multiple e-mails which must then be appended to another and  
UUdecoded. This can be avoided using the "size" command following  
the "open" statement, e.g. "size 1000000". The maximum allowable is 2MB.   
 
Files sizes for NWS radiofax graphic files average 35KB but can be  
much greater especially some satellite images which can approach 1MB. 
Use the "dir" command to ascertain the size of files of interest  
as a precaution.  Users should be aware of the costs for operating  
their particular e-mail system before attempting to use FTPMAIL,  
especially when using satellite communication systems.  For marine  
users,  using FTPMAIL via INMARSAT-C for obtaining current NWS  
radiofax graphic files is cost prohibitive.   Using the FTPMAIL  
compression feature of FTPMAIL is not recommended as these files  
are already in a compressed T4(G4) format enveloped in TIFF for  
viewing. You will need a graphics program capable of displaying  
files in this format in order to view them.  Suggestions for TIFF  
viewers may be found in file  http://weather.noaa.gov/fax/rfaxtif.txt 
 
 
NEW! Radiofax .TIF files now also available as (larger) .gif files 
 
The following examples demonstrate the use of FTPMAIL. Indexes of 
currently available marine products, the list FTPMAIL commands, 
 
and suggestions for TIFF viewers may be obtained following these 
instructions. 
 
 
To use FTPMAIL: 
-In plain text format-

CAUTION - READ THIS HELP FILE CAREFULLY - 99% OF ERRORS USING FTPMAIL  
ARE SIMPLE TYPO'S, INCORRECT CAPITALIZATION, FAILURE TO SEND IN PLAIN  
TEXT FORMAT, LEADING OR TRAILING SPACES, OR FAILURE TO SET UP ANY SPAM  
FILTERS PROPERLY. FOLLOW THE EXAMPLES CLOSELY! 
 
FTPMAIL e-mail requests must be sent in ASCII/Plain Text only.   
HTML formatting will likely result in no response from the FTPMAIL 
server. 
 
Make certain you have not enabled any auto-reply function in your email  
system. 
 
If you see the following response and believe your script to be correct, 
the most likely  problem is that you are sending your e-mail in HTML  
format rather than the required plain text format.   
 
<FTP EMAIL> response 
ftpmail has failed to queue your request with an error of: 
 Must have an 'open [site [user [pass]]]' 
 
 
tgftp.nws.noaa.gov is the only valid FTP site for this service. 
 
Problems have been reported by users of Hotmail. (This may now be fixed)  
 
If you restrict incoming e-mail as a means of preventing spam, you 
must program your e-mail system to allow messages from: 
ftpmail@ftpmail.nws.noaa.gov 
 
The majority of error messages have been disabled.   You may or may 
not receive an error message back from FTPMAIL if your script is in 
error. 
 
FTPMAIL problems are occasionally encountered when embedded control 
characters are received within the e-mail message received by the  
FTPMAIL server.  These control characters may be introduced by the  
user's e-mail system and may be unavoidable.  
 
Also be certain that each of your commands does not have any leading 
and/or trailing space(s) or you may see an error message with a number  
of statements saying "=20"  
 
Problems may also be encountered in trying to go down several levels 
of directories simultaneously, e.g. "cd data/forecasts/marine/test". 
Use a series of commands "cd data", "cd forecasts", "cd marine" instead. 
In both these instances, the likely error will be "Directory not Found" 
 
If the FTPMAIL server is too busy, you will receive an e-mail with a  
 
subject line similar to: "ftpmail job queuing for retry queue/097095.69568" 
Your request will be resubmitted automatically and your requested  
file(s) should be received within several hours.

Read the help file carefully - 99% of errors using FTPMAIL are simple  
typo's, incorrect capitalization, failure to send in plain text format,  
leading or trailing spaces, or failure to set up any spam filters properly.   
  
These instructions are subject to revision....download frequently. 
  
  
National Weather Service marine text forecasts and radiofax charts are  
available via e-mail via an FTPMAIL server.  Further, FTPMAIL may be used  
to acquire any file on the tgftp.nws.noaa.gov FTP server. The FTPMAIL server  
is intended to allow Internet access for mariners and other users who do not  
have direct access to the World Wide Web but who are equipped with an e-mail  
system.  Turnaround is generally less than one hour, however, performance  
may vary widely and receipt cannot be guaranteed. To get started in using the  
NWS FTPMAIL service, follow these simple directions to obtain the FTPMAIL  
"help" file (11 KBytes), or see   http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/fax/ftpmail.txt

>>>>NOAA/NWS Products Not Available via FTPMAIL<<<< 
Not all NWS forecast products are available via FTP and therefore  
accessible via FTPMAIL such as worldwide computer generated model  
forecasts which include areas beyond the area of U.S. forecasting  
responsibility such as the Indian Ocean and South Atlantic.

(http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/product_table.shtml?-multi_1-) 
and other forecasts via e-mail, use one of the www-to-email systems  
such as SAILDOCS or OTHERS described below.  Be aware computer generated  
products from forecast models are not reviewed by forecasters and are  
therefore subject to error. E.G. per the Wave Watch III webpage:

USEFUL MARINE WEATHER PUBLICATIONS 
 
Marine Service Charts (MSC) - Free 
Marine Service Charts (MSC) list frequencies, schedules and locations of stations disseminating 
NWS products. They also contain additional weather information of interest to the mariner. 
Charts are also available via the Internet as listed below. 
Both sides of the charts are available, both in JPG and PDF formats. The front side of the charts 
shows the map and the back side shows the text that accompanies the chart. PDF format is 
helpful if you need to zoom in on a specific area of the chart.  
Note - As a result of budgetary constraints, these Marine Service Charts are no longer 
being updated and may contain outdated information. In some cases the amount and/or 
types of outdated information has resulted in the unfortunate situation that we can no 
longer justify continuing to make that chart available. Updated information can most often 
be found on the Marine Forecasts or NOAA Weather Radio webpages or from your Local 
Weather Forecast Office.

NOAA WEATHER RADIO NETWORK 
 
 
(1) 162.550 MHz 
(2) 162.400 MHz 
(3) 162.475 MHz  
(4) 162.425 MHz  
(5) 162.450 MHz  
(6) 162.500 MHz       
(7) 162.525 MHz      
 
 
Channel numbers, e.g. (WX1, WX2) etc. have no special significance but are often designated this way in 
consumer equipment. Other channel numbering schemes are also prevalent. 
 
The NOAA Weather Radio network provides voice broadcasts of local and coastal marine forecasts on a 
continuous cycle. The forecasts are produced by local National Weather Service Forecast Offices. 
Coastal stations also broadcast predicted tides and real time observations from buoys and coastal 
meteorological stations operated by NOAA's National Data Buoy Center. Based on user demand, and 
where feasible, Offshore and Open Lake forecasts are broadcast as well.  
 
The NOAA Weather Radio network provides near continuous coverage of the coastal U.S, Great Lakes, 
Hawaii, and populated Alaska coastline.  Typical coverage is 25 nautical miles offshore, but may extend 
much further in certain areas.
