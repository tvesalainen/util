        <h1>Collision Point Analyses</h1>
        We can analyse collision point when we know two boats:
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Latitude</dt>
            <dd>φ</dd>
            <dt>Longitude</dt>
            <dd>λ</dd>
            <dt>Bearing</dt>
            <dd>α</dd>
            <dt>Speed</dt>
            <dd>s</dd>
        </dl>
        At time t = 0;
        <p>
        Boats position at time t is:
        <p>
            p(t) = (λ+cos(φ)<sup>-1</sup>sin(α)st, φ+cos(α)st) = (a+bt, c+dt)
        </p>
        <p>Distance can be calculated as:
        <p>d(t)<sup>2</sup> = (a<sub>0</sub>+b<sub>0</sub>t-a<sub>1</sub>-b<sub>1</sub>t)<sup>2</sup>+(c<sub>0</sub>+d<sub>0</sub>t-c<sub>1</sub>-d<sub>1</sub>t)<sup>2</sup>
    </body>
