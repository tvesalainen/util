        <h1>Collision Point Analyses</h1>
        We can analyse collision point when we know two boats:
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Latitude</dt>
            <dd>φ</dd>
            <dt>Longitude</dt>
            <dd>λ</dd>
            <dt>Bearing</dt>
            <dd>α</dd>
            <dt>Speed</dt>
            <dd>s</dd>
        </dl>
        At time t = 0;
        <p>
        Boats position at time t is:
        <p>
            p(t) = (φ+cos(α)st, λ+cos(φ)sin(α)st)
        </p>
        <p>Minimum distance can be calculated by creating distance function which will be 2nd grade polynom and resolving
        it's minimum points.</p>
